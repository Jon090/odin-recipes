For this assignment I will be praticing my git commit messages,pushing them to github and including a subject line and body. 

I will also be practicing my HTML skills, by building a recipe website.

Some things i'm worried about include pushing commit messages, its been a little bit and I read them over again but I haven't done much. I have the notes to go back over but seems like there's a lot involved. Surely, over time, it will become easier. 

HTML i'm not very worried about, I spent a lot of time practicing it, i'm pretty sure I could build this webpage from scratch without referring to notes right now. We will see how true that is.
