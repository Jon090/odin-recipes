<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The finest beef from mongolian monk massaged cattle</li>
        <li>Bell Peppers grown inside of the libery bell, in Philly</li>
        <li>Sweet onions grown by Willy Wonka</li>
        <li>Mushrooms grown at the tips of california redwoods</li>
        <li>Cheese whiz made by a cheese wizzard named Gandolf the Cheddar<sup>[1]</sup></li>
        <li>Mayo made from eggs that come from chickens found in The Legend of Zelda</li>
        <li>Bread that is so soft and fluffy, it could only have been made inside of a cloud</li>

    </ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol type="I" Start="4">
        <p>The first 3 steps are evident for the recipe at hand, but i'll briefly state them here and start
        the actual steps list at at step 4. 20 minutes of intense sandwich meditation, 15 minute cold plunge
        for maximum sandwich intensity, and lastly, stare <strong><ins>deeply</ins></strong>, into the beef, for 3 minutes, 
        so it knows whats coming</p>
        <li>First you must shave the mongolian beef into 1/4" slices, using a samurai sword</li>
        <li>Spend 10 years of your life studying the moon phases, master the wanning moon style 
            and cut your peppers into slices that mimic this style.</li>
        <li>Find a golden ticket for a Wonka factory tour, go in, steal several sweet onions,
            fight no less than 27 oompa loompas on the wayout and no more than 28.</li>
                <ul><li>Use same moon technique for slicing</ul></li>
        <li>Gandolf the cheddar will be blasting off fire works with midgets, find him, hang out, he's chill.
            Then embark on an epic conquest where you'll eventually come across a demon named balrog. Gandolf
            will say "run, you fools" <strong><mark><ins>DO NOT DO THIS</ins></mark></strong> instead, take cheese wizz
            made by Gandolf and defeat balrog with it, thus altering historic events. Then use this toasted whizz.</li>
        <li>You may think all you need to do is collect these eggs and crack them, but really, you need to sword chop
            these industricble chickens like 15 times. I'm not sure the actual amount but you'll know when you've gone 
            far enough.</li>
        <li>Ever heard of Nimbus? Capture it...</li>
