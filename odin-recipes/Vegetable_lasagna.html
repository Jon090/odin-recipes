<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Grandma brought out all the good stuff for this lasgna, except! Whats that?!? Grandma
    accidentally brought a freezer bag of coffee grounds instead of hamburger meat?
    (Why does that exist?) Silly grandma, at 98 years old, she's bound to make mistakes.
    <del>Hopefully she remembers the hamburger next time she drives over..</del><small>why is she still driving!!!</small>
    </p>

    <p>So what now? Well, luckily, you can still make an amazing lasgna without meat!
    Here, we have a vegetable lasgna. The big 3 make an appearance, Bell Peppers, 
    Mushrooms, and Onions. I personally prefer an alfredo brocolli lasgna, but this 
    version is tasty as well!

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 package of wavy sheet noodles</li>
        <li>More olive oil than you know exists</li>
        <li>47 onions</li>
        <li>15 bell peppers</li>
        <li>187 mushrooms</li>
        <li>buncha tomatos to make your own pasta sauce from scratch</li>
        <li>ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesean cheese</li>
    </ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol start="482">
        <li>... and mush the tomatos yet further between your fingers, singing the italian national anthem</li>
        <li>Move the steam roller and pick up the flattened cheese</li>
        <li>Now that the olives are ripe, pluck them from the tree, don't forget to smell them or the process
            will have to start again!</li>
        <li>We are now ready to begin putting the lasgna together! Start loading logs into your newly built 
            brick oven furnace!</li>
